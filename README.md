# react-init
A starter kit for creating the React JS applications.
Inspired by video tutorials from [@mschwarzmueller](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller) (üëç the "german quality").
You can explore his very useful tutorials for the different IT directions on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w).
